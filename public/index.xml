      <description>Last week, I posted to LinkedIn about successfully helping a friend in her job search, which got thousands of views and a ton of positive feedback. I started getting overwhelmed with dozens of connection requests from folks in the data science industry, or trying to break into the industry, so I used this momentum to create a Collaborative Data Careers Community LinkedIn group, which is now nearly 400 members strong.</description>

      <description>Statistical Learning When I did my undergrad at Clemson, I majored in Management, which was a Bachelor of Science program. As such, it heavily comprised science and math courses. I did really well in the maths and statistics classes that I took, (I think I always scored high A&amp;rsquo;s, and so I even tutored for the Advanced Multi-variable Calculus classes after I had taken them.) However, even though I was good at it, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like higher level math all that much.</description>

      <description>Hello! I work at CARFAX as a Data Scientist on the Business Development team and help coordinate research projects across the company. I previously worked on the Data Services team, where I helped engineer massive data loads into our vehicle history database. I started learning the R language a couple of years ago, and have used it daily since then, for hundreds of ad-hoc data analyses. I have also used R and Shiny to develop several internal dashboards and apps.</description>

      <description>The story of my website I have had a website here for the past 10+ years. The main purpose was to have it for my personal email address, and when i set it up, I integrated it into the beta Google Apps for Business program, (which has long been renamed google suite [Thankfully, I was grandfathered in with a free account.]) Back in the day, I was really interested in web design and I helped a few non-profits design their own websites.</description>
