Hello!  I work at CARFAX as a Data Scientist on the Business Development team and help coordinate research projects across the company.  I previously worked on the Data Services team, where I helped engineer massive data loads into our vehicle history database.  I started learning the R language a couple of years ago, and have used it daily since then, for hundreds of ad-hoc data analyses.  I have also used R and <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> to develop several internal dashboards and apps.  I consider myself an R enthusiast, and love using the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a>.
</br></br>
I enjoy constantly learning.  In my spare time, I have been learning more about new R packages and functionality, Python, and computer science in general.  I hope to share more about these topics on my blog here, and, when possible, how to connect these things to business needs.  This blog is new and not guaranteed to be actively updated, but you can typically find me somewhat active in an <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats">#rstats</a> echochamber on twitter, or in the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/datascience/">#datascience</a> linkedin community.
</br></br>
On a personal note, I am from the Carolinas, but currently live in the Northern Virginia area.  Other things that I enjoy include studying hebrew and Judaism, traveling the world, biking, hiking, and spending time with my wife, Susanne, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maplesablecorgi/">our corgi, Maple</a>.</p>
